# Mission Statement

Hello and welcome to the PowerTools github page.  PowerTools is a Dynamics 365 PowerApp that I hope will be embraced by the Dynamics 365 Community as the next best thing to enable high fidelity customizations as it matures.

The pillars of design/architecture are:
- **PowerTools live on the Power Platform** - this means that there is no standalone desktop application and that extensions live within the model driven application as a combination of web resources, flows, actions, entities, attributes, plugin code, etc.
- **PowerTools are modern-looking and fit the design of the new Unified Interface** - Dynamics 365, and most other products in the Microsoft 365 stack, have embraced the latest industry standards by utilizing frameworks such as React and Office-Fabric-UI. The benefits are self-evident after a bit of a learning curve.  PowerTools will follow suit with this initiative so that the customizations are seamless, fast to develop, and fast to the user.
